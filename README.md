# Algorithms_PS

This repository is used for back-up my solutions when I solve algorithm problems.

Every solutions are coded by C++ with Visual Studio 2017 on Windows 10.

Some solutions are from a book named 'Algorithm Problem Solving Strategies', in that case, I will leave comment in the source.
